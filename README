This is a simple searcher for Etsy.com.  Upon running, it opens a new browser window/tab with a random, active item from
Etsy's site.

It is written in Python version 2.7.3.  Tried to use Java initially, but that plan was quickly aborted.

Still a few frustrating bugs to work out.  Planned improvements include search parameters, weeding out bugs,
and more efficiently determing whether an item listing is still active or not.

Credit for Version 1 goes out to Mike F. as well.
